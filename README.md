# React Template

This is my version of Create-React-App with only the core functionalities I need such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) alongside with subtle packages like [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) and a bunch of Webpack/eslint plugins.
